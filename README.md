## My version
I am following the flutter course on Udemy. Given by Angela Yu. 
I made this repo public so other students can look at my work and learn ( usually howto NOT do it...)
Just as I on a regular basis look at other students repo's just to learn. 

This repo is not going to be published as an app in any of the app stores. 

Regards, Martijn.

## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
